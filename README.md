# chrome-readnow

Tries to make the body text on a page more readable inside the page itself
without removing any other content.

Right now the fonts are hardcoded into the source code so if you want to
change them you need to edit the source.

	* Body text: [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/releases)
	* Code: [InconsolataLGC](https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC/releases)
